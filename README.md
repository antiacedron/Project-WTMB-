# Project-WTMB-
This is my project in Javascript (WTMB) 
I thought that I would like to build an app about exchange books. So a person can share his/her small library at home and create together a enormous public library. The variables I will use for now are people, books and cities. So to know if a person has a book, where is located, if it is reading it or just host it until another person wants to take it.
